# JAVASCRIPT ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS

## Assignment operator
___The assignment operator `=` is the simplest value assigning operator which assigns a given value to a variable.  The assignment operators support chaining, which means you can assign a single value in multiple variables in a single line.___

## Addition assignment operator
___The addition assignment operator `+=` is used to add the value of the right operand to the value of the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
On the basis of the data type of variable, the addition assignment operator may add or concatenate the variables.___

## Subtraction assignment operator
___The subtraction assignment operator `-=` subtracts the value of the right operand from the value of the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
If the value can not be subtracted then it results in a `NaN`.___

## Multiplication assignment operator
___The multiplication assignment operator `*=` assigns the result to the left operand after multiplying values of the left and right operand___.

## Division assignment operator
___The division assignment operator `/=` divides the value of the left operand by the value of the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.___

## Remainder assignment operator
___The remainder assignment operator `%=` assigns the remainder to the left operand after dividing the value of the left operand by the value of the right operand.___

## Exponentiation assignment operator
___The exponential assignment operator `**=` assigns the result of exponentiation to the left operand after exponentiating the value of the left operand by the value of the right operand.___

## Left shift assignment
___The left shift assignment operator `<<=` assigns the result of the left shift to the left operand after shifting the value of the left operand by the value of the right operand.___

## Right shift assignment
___The right shift assignment operator `>>=` assigns the result of the right shift to the left operand after shifting the value of the left operand by the value of the right operand.___

## Unsigned right shift assignment
___The unsigned right shift assignment operator `>>>=` assigns the result of the unsigned right shift to the left operand after shifting the value of the left operand by the value of the right operand.___

## Bitwise AND assignment
___The bitwise AND assignment operator `&`= assigns the result of bitwise AND to the left operand after ANDing the value of the left operand by the value of the right operand.___

### Bitwise OR assignment
___The bitwise OR assignment operator `|=` assigns the result of bitwise OR to the left operand after ORing the value of left operand by the value of the right operand.___

## Bitwise XOR assignment
___The bitwise XOR assignment operator `^=` assigns the result of bitwise XOR to the left operand after XORing the value of the left operand by the value of the right operand.___

## Logical AND assignment
___he logical OR assignment operator `||=` assigns value to left operand only when it is falsy.___

## Logical nullish assignment

___The logical nullish assignment operator `??=` assigns value to left operand only when it is nullish (`null` or `undefined`).___

## Increment/decrement
Increasing or decreasing a number by one is among the most common numerical operations.

So, there are special operators for it:

___Increment `++` increases a variable by 1___

___Decrement `--` decreases a variable by 1:___

The operators `++` and `--` can be placed either before or after a variable.

When the operator goes after the variable, it is in “postfix form”: `counter++`.
The “prefix form” is when the operator goes before the variable: `++counter`.
Both of these statements do the same thing: increase `counter` by `1`.

Is there any difference? Yes, but we can only see it if we use the returned value of `++/--`.

Let’s clarify. As we know, all operators return a value. Increment/decrement is no exception. The prefix form returns the new value while the postfix form returns the old value (prior to increment/decrement).
